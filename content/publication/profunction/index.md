My first article ever, published by the glorious MC Microcomputer magazine in 1990.
With Gianni Calcerano, my fellow friend and future cofounder of my first company, Shark snc, we created a nice math function plotting software which we later extended to symbolic calculus.

The article is still available [here](https://issuu.com/adpware/docs/mc096/266), though the code is probably lost forever.
