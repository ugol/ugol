I have more than 20 years experience in software development and IT industry. I have matured a significant competency in distributed applications, starting in the other century when it wasn't even a buzzword - [JINI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jini), anyone?. I have worked as a designer, lead architect or coach in many different projects for many different companies.
I had the chance to work with a lot of different methods, processes and tools and had the opportunity to teach and talk about what I have learned in ILT (Instructor's Led Training) courses, in seminars in front of hundreds of people, at the University as well as on [national TV](https://store.uninettuno.it/it/cyberspazioecomcatalogomateria.aspx?courseid=2938&langid=it&planid=84&degreeid=137), greatly enhancing my communication skills.
